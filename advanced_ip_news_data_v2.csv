(Nasdaq: SILO) (“Silo” or the “Company”), a developmental stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel therapeutics and drug delivery systems, today announced the filing of a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This application, focused on its lead asset SPC-15, highlights Silo’s commitment to advancing treatments for stress-induced psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The provisional patent covers the chronic, combinatorial targeting of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and serotonin type IV receptors (5-HT4Rs) to extend behavioral effects against stress-induced perseverative behavior and hyponeophagia. This filing adds to Silo’s growing portfolio of pending patents for SPC-15 technology, originally licensed through a collaboration with Columbia University. This exclusive agreement enables Silo to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SPC-15 globally.

“Silo Pharma’s intellectual property strategy continues to be a cornerstone of our growth,” said Eric Weisblum, CEO of Silo Pharma. “We believe this latest provisional patent application reinforces our strong IP protection for SPC-15 and further positions us to deliver innovative therapies for patients with PTSD and other stress-induced disorders.”

About SPC-15SPC-15 is an intranasal serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist aimed at treating stress-induced psychiatric disorders such as PTSD and anxiety. With its potential eligibility for the FDA’s streamlined 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, SPC-15 offers a promising approach to accelerate the approval process. Silo Pharma is collaborating with Columbia University to conduct preclinical studies and has exclusive global rights to the development and commercialization of SPC-15.

(Nasdaq: SILO) is a developmental stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing underserved conditions, including stress-induced psychiatric disorders, chronic pain, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

(Nasdaq: SILO) (“Silo” or the “Company”), a developmental stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel therapeutics and drug delivery systems, today announced the filing of a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This application, focused on its lead asset SPC-15, highlights Silo’s commitment to advancing treatments for stress-induced psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The provisional patent covers the chronic, combinatorial targeting of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and serotonin type IV receptors (5-HT4Rs) to extend behavioral effects against stress-induced perseverative behavior and hyponeophagia. This filing adds to Silo’s growing portfolio of pending patents for SPC-15 technology, originally licensed through a collaboration with Columbia University. This exclusive agreement enables Silo to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SPC-15 globally.

“Silo Pharma’s intellectual property strategy continues to be a cornerstone of our growth,” said Eric Weisblum, CEO of Silo Pharma. “We believe this latest provisional patent application reinforces our strong IP protection for SPC-15 and further positions us to deliver innovative therapies for patients with PTSD and other stress-induced disorders.”

About SPC-15SPC-15 is an intranasal serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist aimed at treating stress-induced psychiatric disorders such as PTSD and anxiety. With its potential eligibility for the FDA’s streamlined 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, SPC-15 offers a promising approach to accelerate the approval process. Silo Pharma is collaborating with Columbia University to conduct preclinical studies and has exclusive global rights to the development and commercialization of SPC-15.

About Silo PharmaSilo Pharma Inc. (Nasdaq: SILO) is a developmental stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing underserved conditions, including stress-induced psychiatric disorders, chronic pain, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The Company’s portfolio includes innovative programs such as SPC-15 for PTSD, SP-26 for fibromyalgia and chronic pain, and preclinical assets targeting Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. Silo’s research is conducted in collaboration with leading universities and laboratories. silopharma.com
