SAN DIEGO â Inside her home workshop, 24-year-old Danielle Boyer is revolutionizing how Indigenous youth connect with technology and their heritage.

Boyer, founder ofÂ The STEAM Connection, created SKOBOTS â animal-shaped robots that perch on shoulders and teach endangered Indigenous languages. The interactive devices help students learn traditional words, starting with ""bozho,"" which means hello.

""When you lose your language, you lose a lot of your culture, and you lose an ability to communicate with each other about your culture andÂ very meaningfulÂ things,"" Boyer says.

As a member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe, Boyer understands firsthand the barriers Native American students face in STEAM fields.Â Indigenous peoplesÂ comprise just 0.4% of the engineering workforce, according toÂ Northern Arizona University.

""There was a local robotics team, but it was hundreds of dollars to participate. When you don't have a lot of money, that's just not doable,"" she said.

This disparity prompted Boyer to launch the STEAM Connection at age 18. The nonprofit started by distributing free $20 eco-friendly robot kits to Indigenous students. To date, they've distributed 20,000 kits.

The organization's impact extends beyond robotics. Boyer mentored a 15-year-old student who developed ""Super Sisters,"" an interactive STEAM education app that has attracted 35,000 users and secured an MIT grant.

""People often forget about Indigenous peoples, that we're not just peoples of the past,"" Boyer says. ""We exist right now as modern peoples, and we're going to exist in the future. Robotics is a really cool way to present that concept.""

The STEAM Connection is now a finalist for Stanford University's $145,000Â Westley Prize for Young California Social Innovators, with winners toÂ be announcedÂ Saturday. If awarded, Boyer plans to expand the program's reach, providing more Indigenous students with resources like stipends and MacBooks to develop their own innovations.

""It'sÂ a really bigÂ deal because usually we're the youngest in the room,"" Boyer says. ""People don't always take Indigenous people seriously. They don't see us as intelligent or connected to technology.""

Boyer's work has caught international attention. This week, sheÂ received an invitationÂ to speak at a United Nations language summit.

""Our peoples have always been inventors and scientists and innovators â my people invented snowshoes,"" Boyer says. ""I want to always carry that legacy forward and remind our students that they're inventors, they're creators, they're scientists.""","['/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg', '/assets/shared-images/logos/kfmb.png', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/e12077c6-5651-4382-b8f8-55e71ffb9dc8/20250123T021535/e12077c6-5651-4382-b8f8-55e71ffb9dc8_16x9.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/e12077c6-5651-4382-b8f8-55e71ffb9dc8/20250123T021535/e12077c6-5651-4382-b8f8-55e71ffb9dc8_360x203.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/a7506952-49dc-4ea0-8980-ee4d1c0f6e5a/a7506952-49dc-4ea0-8980-ee4d1c0f6e5a_16x9.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/a7506952-49dc-4ea0-8980-ee4d1c0f6e5a/a7506952-49dc-4ea0-8980-ee4d1c0f6e5a_360x203.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/fba6ba6d-cc6e-4e30-80d9-69f43caccf5c/fba6ba6d-cc6e-4e30-80d9-69f43caccf5c_16x9.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/fba6ba6d-cc6e-4e30-80d9-69f43caccf5c/fba6ba6d-cc6e-4e30-80d9-69f43caccf5c_360x203.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/cacc5454-7bb8-4fe0-95e1-dcc4336ad4de/20241108T172518/cacc5454-7bb8-4fe0-95e1-dcc4336ad4de_16x9.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/cacc5454-7bb8-4fe0-95e1-dcc4336ad4de/20241108T172518/cacc5454-7bb8-4fe0-95e1-dcc4336ad4de_360x203.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/1e44a2db-9408-4e4c-9a83-12a8eb523883/1e44a2db-9408-4e4c-9a83-12a8eb523883_16x9.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/1e44a2db-9408-4e4c-9a83-12a8eb523883/1e44a2db-9408-4e4c-9a83-12a8eb523883_360x203.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/d9033fb1-e743-4c4f-a728-38c8c55e41f7/20241206T023023/d9033fb1-e743-4c4f-a728-38c8c55e41f7_16x9.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/d9033fb1-e743-4c4f-a728-38c8c55e41f7/20241206T023023/d9033fb1-e743-4c4f-a728-38c8c55e41f7_360x203.jpg', '/assets/shared-images/logos/native/kfmb.svg', '/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/clear-day_210x210.png', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/6efdf955-002b-420c-94aa-ba63f06530f8/20250122T032711/6efdf955-002b-420c-94aa-ba63f06530f8_1920x1080.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/6efdf955-002b-420c-94aa-ba63f06530f8/20250122T032711/6efdf955-002b-420c-94aa-ba63f06530f8_1920x1080.jpg', 'https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/6efdf955-002b-420c-94aa-ba63f06530f8/20250122T032711/6efdf955-002b-420c-94aa-ba63f06530f8_1920x1080.jpg', '/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg', '/assets/shared-images/logos/kfmb.png', '/assets/shared-images/logos/kfmb.png']",[],[]

With its potential eligibility for the FDAâs streamlined 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, SPC-15 offers a promising approach to accelerate the approval process. Silo Pharma is collaborating with Columbia University to conduct preclinical studies and has exclusive global rights to the development and commercialization of SPC-15.
