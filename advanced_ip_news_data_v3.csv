(Nasdaq: SILO) (“Silo” or the “Company”), a developmental stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel therapeutics and drug delivery systems, today announced the filing of a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This application, focused on its lead asset SPC-15, highlights Silo’s commitment to advancing treatments for stress-induced psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The provisional patent covers the chronic, combinatorial targeting of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and serotonin type IV receptors (5-HT4Rs) to extend behavioral effects against stress-induced perseverative behavior and hyponeophagia. This filing adds to Silo’s growing portfolio of pending patents for SPC-15 technology, originally licensed through a collaboration with Columbia University. This exclusive agreement enables Silo to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SPC-15 globally.

“Silo Pharma’s intellectual property strategy continues to be a cornerstone of our growth,” said Eric Weisblum, CEO of Silo Pharma. “We believe this latest provisional patent application reinforces our strong IP protection for SPC-15 and further positions us to deliver innovative therapies for patients with PTSD and other stress-induced disorders.”

About SPC-15SPC-15 is an intranasal serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist aimed at treating stress-induced psychiatric disorders such as PTSD and anxiety. With its potential eligibility for the FDA’s streamlined 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, SPC-15 offers a promising approach to accelerate the approval process. Silo Pharma is collaborating with Columbia University to conduct preclinical studies and has exclusive global rights to the development and commercialization of SPC-15.

About Silo PharmaSilo Pharma Inc. (Nasdaq: SILO) is a developmental stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing underserved conditions, including stress-induced psychiatric disorders, chronic pain, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

The upcoming assignment against India will be McCullum's first in white-ball cricket, having coached the Test team with plenty of success since May 2022. IND vs ENG Dream11 Team Prediction, 1st T20I 2025: Tips and Suggestions To Pick Best Winning Fantasy Playing XI for India vs England Match in Kolkata.

""I know it's going to be a tough tour, taking on a very good Indian side, but I'm sure we'll play what I hope is a very watchful style of cricket,"" McCullum told reporters here.

The tour begins with the first of the five-match T20I series at Eden Gardens on Wednesday, followed by three one-day internationals.

""It's great, actually. That's really exciting, I think. Obviously, we've known for a couple of months this was going to unfold, and it's been great.""

The ODI series is seen as dress rehearsal for both teams ahead of the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy, which will be held in Pakistan and Dubai from February 19.

""We'll use the next few weeks to try and hit the ground running, I'm sure there will be some times where we don't quite get it right. But, hopefully, we will chisel away at that over the next few weeks, and we'll be in good shape come that Champions Trophy."" he said.

The 43-year-old was appointed England's white-ball coach in September, succeeding Matthew Mott, and he will now juggle between his role as Test coach while guiding the limited-overs side. In India, England will play five T20Is and three ODIs. Despite England's penchant for power-hitting, McCullum emphasised the importance of adapting to conditions and making the most of their resources.

""You won't win every game we play, right? We're fiercely competitive and want to be successful, but for us, the conversations in the dressing room are different. It's about getting the best out of the talent we have, gelling the guys together, and finding the right complementary skills.""

He acknowledged that the team has all the ingredients to succeed in India.

""We've got a batting lineup that's as powerful as any in the world. We've got gun spinners, top fielders, and guys who bowl absolute rockets with the ball. It's about using those strengths to entertain and maximise our chances.""

England skipper Jos Buttler was part of the team's 2019 World Cup-winning squad and led them to the T20 world title in 2022 but there has been a downward spiral since then.

""He is excited about the team we have got and the opportunity that sits in front of us,"" said McCullum of Buttler.

""I am sure we will see Jos over the next couple of years really enjoy himself and finish with a real strong enjoyment of the game at the back end of his career. Sometimes when you get the opportunity to lead in the latter part of your career there are times when you can be desperate for success and that can create frustrations and it doesn't become quite as enjoyable.""

""If you can let yourself go with nothing to prove other than getting the best out of those around you, sometimes that can free you up even more and you can perform really strongly. He is fully on board with that. He is excited about the next little while. I am sure you will see him smiling on the field.""

McCullum further said Buttler would play as a specialist batter and not keep wickets on the tour.

""I think he won't be keeping wickets in this series. He's going to catch them from the field, and I think that's a really positive thing for us because it gives Jos the opportunity to have the last say with the bowler and to have that relationship build at their last second rather than being, you know, 22 yards away.""

Mumbai, January 21: Credited with introducing the ultra-aggressive 'Bazball' brand of batting, England coach Brendon McCullum on Monday sprang a surprise by promising to ""play very watchful style of cricket"" in the limited overs series against India. The upcoming assignment against India will be McCullum's first in white-ball cricket, having coached the Test team with plenty of success since May 2022. IND vs ENG Dream11 Team Prediction, 1st T20I 2025: Tips and Suggestions To Pick Best Winning Fantasy Playing XI for India vs England Match in Kolkata.

""I know it's going to be a tough tour, taking on a very good Indian side, but I'm sure we'll play what I hope is a very watchful style of cricket,"" McCullum told reporters here.

The tour begins with the first of the five-match T20I series at Eden Gardens on Wednesday, followed by three one-day internationals.

""It's great, actually. That's really exciting, I think. Obviously, we've known for a couple of months this was going to unfold, and it's been great.""

The ODI series is seen as dress rehearsal for both teams ahead of the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy, which will be held in Pakistan and Dubai from February 19.

""We'll use the next few weeks to try and hit the ground running, I'm sure there will be some times where we don't quite get it right. But, hopefully, we will chisel away at that over the next few weeks, and we'll be in good shape come that Champions Trophy."" he said.

The 43-year-old was appointed England's white-ball coach in September, succeeding Matthew Mott, and he will now juggle between his role as Test coach while guiding the limited-overs side. In India, England will play five T20Is and three ODIs. Despite England's penchant for power-hitting, McCullum emphasised the importance of adapting to conditions and making the most of their resources.

""You won't win every game we play, right? We're fiercely competitive and want to be successful, but for us, the conversations in the dressing room are different. It's about getting the best out of the talent we have, gelling the guys together, and finding the right complementary skills.""

He acknowledged that the team has all the ingredients to succeed in India.

""We've got a batting lineup that's as powerful as any in the world. We've got gun spinners, top fielders, and guys who bowl absolute rockets with the ball. It's about using those strengths to entertain and maximise our chances.""

Balls to it! Inventor Builds Self-Balancing Bike Without Wheels,A British inventor who specialises in self-balancing machines has built a bike that uses balls instead of wheels.,1 day ago,Visordown,https://www.visordown.com/news/balls-it-inventor-builds-self-balancing-bike-without-wheels,Title from Search,Unknown,2025-01-22T14:49:24+00:00,"A British inventor who specialises in self-balancing machines has built a bike that uses balls instead of wheels

If you’re familiar with the inventor and YouTuber James Bruton, you’ll already know he has a penchant for making madcap machines with self-balancing tech and funky wheels.

His latest creation, though, might just be his weirdest to date. He’s created a bike that can balance itself but instead of using his trademark ‘omni-wheel’ design, which features cylinders mounted at an angle along the rim of the ‘wheel’, Bruton has opted for two large spherical wheels… this bike’s basically got massive balls. There, I said it.

Controlling the forward motion of the machine is a motor located at the top and front of each of the spheres, while the balancing element is taken care of by four small motors. Two motors are mounted on the rear of the front ‘wheel’, and two more on the front of the rear ‘wheel’. The motors are mounted with their own omni-wheels which is what moves the spheres and keeps the bike balanced. As the sensors in the bike detect that it's leaning too far one way or the other, the motors can then turn the sphere in the opposite direction, keeping the bike on an even keel. They can also help to rotate the machine, meaning that like Bruton’s omni-wheeled machines, the ball-wheeled bike can move forwards and backwards, while it is also able to strafe from left to right and rotate in any direction.

As with the rest of Bruton’s builds, many of the parts used, including the electronics, are self-made, with the British engineer leaning on his sizable 3D printing skills to create bespoke parts and components. In a nutshell, if you want somebody to take your engineering skills down a peg or two, James Bruton’s YouTube channel is the place to go.

"Hoth Therapeutics Expands Cancer Drug Patent Portfolio, Strengthens HT-001 Development Strategy","Hoth Therapeutics acquires new patents to broaden applications of its HT-001 cancer therapeutic, reinforcing its intellectual property...",2 days ago,Stock Titan,https://www.stocktitan.net/news/HOTH/hoth-therapeutics-expands-intellectual-property-portfolio-with-gdgxvrsyacub.html,Title from Search,Unknown,2025-01-21T13:29:00.000Z,"Hoth Therapeutics (NASDAQ: HOTH) has announced the acquisition and expansion of patent applications to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio. The new patents will be utilized to explore additional indications for the company's HT-001 Cancer Therapeutic.

The company positions these acquisitions as part of its strategy to develop innovative treatments for unmet medical needs, focusing on enhancing therapeutic efficacy and expanding applications across various disease areas. CEO Robb Knie emphasized that these provisional patent applications reinforce Hoth's proprietary approaches and align with their mission to deliver breakthrough therapies.

Hoth Therapeutics (NASDAQ: HOTH) ha annunciato l'acquisizione e l'espansione di domande di brevetto per rafforzare il proprio portafoglio di proprietà intellettuale. I nuovi brevetti saranno utilizzati per esplorare ulteriori indicazioni per il HT-001 Cancer Therapeutic dell'azienda.

L'azienda considera queste acquisizioni come parte della sua strategia per sviluppare trattamenti innovativi per bisogni medici non soddisfatti, focalizzandosi sul miglioramento dell'efficacia terapeutica e sull'espansione delle applicazioni in vari settori patologici. Il CEO Robb Knie ha sottolineato che queste domande di brevetto provvisorie rafforzano gli approcci proprietari di Hoth e si allineano con la loro missione di fornire terapie all'avanguardia.

Hoth Therapeutics (NASDAQ: HOTH)는 지적 재산 포트폴리오를 강화하기 위해 특허 신청을 인수하고 확장했다고 발표했습니다. 새로운 특허는 회사의 HT-001 암 치료제에 대한 추가 적응증을 탐색하는 데 사용될 것입니다.

회사는 이 인수를 충족되지 않은 의료 요구를 위한 혁신적인 치료법을 개발하기 위한 전략의 일환으로 보고 있으며, 치료 효능 향상 및 다양한 질병 영역으로의 적용 확대에 중점을 두고 있습니다. CEO Robb Knie는 이러한 임시 특허 신청이 Hoth의 독자적인 접근 방식을 강화하고 혁신적인 치료를 제공하겠다는 그들의 사명에 부합한다고 강조했습니다.

L'entreprise considère ces acquisitions comme faisant partie de sa stratégie de développement de traitements innovants pour les besoins médicaux non satisfaits, en se concentrant sur l'amélioration de l'efficacité thérapeutique et l'élargissement des applications dans divers domaines de maladies.

Hoth Therapeutics (NASDAQ: HOTH) hat die Akquisition und Erweiterung von Patentanmeldungen bekannt gegeben, um sein geistiges Eigentumsportfolio zu stärken. Die neuen Patente werden genutzt, um zusätzliche Indikationen für das HT-001 Krebsmedikament des Unternehmens zu erkunden.

Das Unternehmen positioniert diese Akquisitionen als Teil seiner Strategie zur Entwicklung innovativer Behandlungen für nicht erfüllte medizinische Bedürfnisse und legt den Fokus auf die Verbesserung der therapeutischen Wirksamkeit und die Erweiterung der Anwendungen in verschiedenen Krankheitsbereichen. CEO Robb Knie betonte, dass diese vorläufigen Patentanmeldungen die proprietären Ansätze von Hoth stärken und mit ihrer Mission, bahnbrechende Therapien bereitzustellen, übereinstimmen.

The patent portfolio expansion for HT-001, while appearing promising on the surface, lacks important details about the specific claims, geographical coverage and potential market exclusivity periods. For a micro-cap company with a $10.3M market capitalization, intellectual property protection is vital, yet this announcement provides insufficient information to gauge the true value addition. The provisional patent applications mentioned suggest early-stage IP protection that still requires significant development to mature into granted patents.

The expansion targeting additional indications for HT-001, their cancer therapeutic, could theoretically broaden the addressable market. However, without specifics on these new indications or preliminary data supporting such expansions, the actual commercial potential remains speculative. For small biotechs, patent strategy often serves as a foundation for future licensing deals or partnerships, but the vagueness of this announcement limits its immediate strategic value.

The market impact of this IP expansion needs to be viewed through the lens of HOTH's current financial position and development stage. With a micro-cap valuation, the company's ability to effectively monetize these patent applications through clinical development is a critical consideration. The absence of financial terms or specific therapeutic targets in the announcement raises questions about the immediate value proposition.

For retail investors, it's essential to understand that provisional patent applications represent just the first step in a lengthy and costly process. While IP protection is fundamental for biotech companies, the lack of detail about potential commercial applications or development timelines makes this news primarily administrative rather than value-creating in the near term. The company's  market cap suggests constrained resources for pursuing multiple indications simultaneously, which could impact the practical utility of this expanded IP portfolio.

IP will be used to pursue further indications for HT-001 Cancer Therapeutic

"Patent filings credit Bharat Biotech as ‘inventor’ of Covaxin, omit ICMR",India's Health Ministry had claimed that COVAXIN intellectual property is “jointly owned” by ICMR and Bharat Biotech but patent documents...,21 Jun 2024,The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/patent-filings-credit-bharat-biotech-as-inventor-of-covaxin-omit-icmr/article68317625.ece,Title from Search,Unknown,2024-06-21T22:46:48+05:30,"India’s first indigenously developed coronavirus vaccine, Covaxin, was a joint collaboration between the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) with intellectual property (IP) rights jointly shared between the two organisations. That is what the public record states. However, filings by the BBIL at patent offices in India, the United States and Europe suggest that only its scientists and personnel are credited as ‘inventors’ of the vaccine with no mention of ICMR scientists.

The Hindu has viewed documents detailing these patent applications. If BBIL personnel, credited in applications as Deepak Kumar and Krishna Murthy Ella — Chairman and Founder, BBIL— are indeed the only inventors, it contradicts a statement by the Union Health Ministry, the nodal Ministry of the ICMR, in the Rajya Sabha, which claimed that the IP rights are “jointly owned”.

ICMR got ₹171.74 crore in royalty from Covaxin sale, Rajya Sabha told

WHO pauses Covaxin supply via UN bodies

In response to a question in the Rajya Sabha on July 2021 by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, who demanded details of the agreement between the ICMR and the BBIL for the development of Covaxin, the then Minister of State (Health Ministry) Bharati Pravin Pawar laid out a detailed response.

The Minister’s statement said the ICMR would provide a “well characterised” virus strain for vaccine development, the BBIL would develop the final vaccine formulation and, be given a “non-exclusive” licence granted to commercialise the product within two years. It was explicitly mentioned that the “..intellectual property over the product would be jointly owned by the ICMR and the BBIL.” The ICMR would also receive as royalty 5% of net sales to be remitted half-yearly.

BHU’s Covaxin safety study riddled with major limitations

Why COVID vaccine safety needs scrutiny | Explained

ICMR distances itself from BHU’s Covaxin study

The ICMR said that while it had not funded the BBIL for Covaxin development, one of its institutes — the ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune — had spent “funds for Covaxin development“.

It also funded phase-3 clinical trials of Covaxin at 25 locations, involving 25,800 participants. All in all, the ICMR spent ₹35 crore for developing Covaxin. As of January 2022 — as per an update by the government to the Rajya Sabha — the ICMR received ₹171 crore as royalty for Covaxin.

Ms. Pawar’s response to Parliament, however, did not elaborate on the sharing of patent rights. The BBIL, which has over the years had several research collaborations with public research bodies such as the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the ICMR itself, has listed scientists from all institutions as ‘inventors’ in patent applications.

A BBIL spokesperson told The Hindu that the patent filed by Bharat Biotech was only for “process development” and specific to the making of the vaccine. It also covered the use of an adjuvant (an ingredient used in vaccines to elicit a stronger response) that was licensed from the Kansas-based ViroVax and added to Covaxin.

India’s patent laws allow both product and process patents. Product patents grant an inventor a monopoly over, say, a drug. Process patents bar competitors from making a similar drug using the same sequence of steps. “Bharat Biotech is innovator of the process developed after procuring strain from the NIV through an agreed consideration between both the parties. Moreover, the NIV was also responsible for testing for other variants. It is to be noted that while ICMR/NIV owns the animal challenge (clinical trials on animals) studies, Bharat Biotech owns the process development and new adjuvant added to the vaccine.” In the case of the CSIR, product development involved funding from both the CSIR and the BBIL and hence merited co-inventorship during patent applications, the spokesperson’s email suggested. The BBIL did not clarify on who owned the rights to the human clinical trial data — information that is usually not disclosed by pharmaceutical companies.

The ICMR’s close involvement in all aspects of Covaxin development is well known, particularly — as former chief Dr. Balram Bhargava has described in his book, Going Viral: The Making of Covaxin, how ICMR scientists isolated the Sars-Cov2 strain from Italian tourists in March 2020, gave it to Bharat Biotech which developed a batch of vaccine candidates by April 30 that were then used to conduct pre-clinical animal studies on rats, hamsters, monkeys and following encouraging results, trials on humans. All of the resulting publications that describe the results of these trials — some published in leading journals such as TheLancet — list both ICMR scientists as well as scientists from the BBIL as co-authors in the study.

An independent expert said collaborating entities usually clearly spell out how IPR and patenting rights from a resulting invention would be shared in a memorandum of understanding (MoU). “There could be multiple kinds of agreements and only a perusal of the MoU can clarify on such matters,” an IPR lawyer, who declined to be identified as he consulted both of these organisations, told The Hindu. The ICMR has previously declined Right to Information requests by activists and media on the terms of this MoU citing “third party confidentiality”.

“This raises some important questions. If intellectual property is jointly owned, then patent applications require that all the inventors be mentioned. In the United States, for instance, not mentioning all inventors can be strong grounds for the rejection of patents,” Dr. Zakir Thomas, who was previously been involved in intellectual property development at the CSIR, told The Hindu.  “While intellectual property is a broad term, only one of which is patents, the ICMR should clarify the statement made to Parliament on what it means by co-ownership and whether it collaborated in the development.” The Hindu emailed to Dr. Rajiv Bahl, Director-General, ICMR, but has received no response till going to press. Dr. Bhargava, who has now retired from the ICMR and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, declined comment.
